# Task-1---Titanic-Survival-Prediction1
## Overview
This project uses the Titanic dataset to predict passenger survival based on various features like age, gender, and passenger class. The dataset is a well-known introductory dataset for machine learning tasks.

## Files
- **`titanic.csv`**: The dataset containing passenger details and survival status.
- **`task1.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook with the entire workflow, including data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `scikit-learn`
  - `matplotlib`
  - `seaborn`

## How to Run
1. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Open the `task1.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter and run all cells.

## Steps
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing data, encode categorical variables, and scale features.
2. **Model Building**: Train several machine learning models such as Logistic Regression and Random Forest.
3. **Evaluation**: Assess the models using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

## Conclusion
The notebook demonstrates how to use machine learning techniques to predict survival on the Titanic.
